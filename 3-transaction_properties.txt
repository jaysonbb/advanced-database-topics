Properties of transactions
--------------------------
solution for both conurrency and failures, appear to run and isolation, run entirely or not at all

ACID properties
	A -> atomicity
	C -> consistency
	I -> isolation
	D -> durability
	
	isolation
		a whole shit ton of clients working on db
		each client issues sequence of transactions to db 
		each transaction can be a sequence of statement which are treated as a unit
		
		serializability:
			operations w/in transactions may be interleaved, but execution must be equivalent to some sequential (serial) order of all transactions
			
			what the hell does that mean? do you ask?
				the system must guarantee that the state of the database reflects as if the transactions were executed in order. regardless of interleaving of statements
